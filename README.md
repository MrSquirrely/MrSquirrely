#Hello and Welcome to my Branch!ðŸ‘‹
-----
#### My name is James but you can just call me Mr. Squirrely!

I am a software developer who loves creating! I currently use dotnet technology building WPF applications and libraries!
I love learning new things when I have the chance. That's why a lot of the time I'm recoding old projects of mine.
I use my projects to learn more and more about C# and how to code better!

Currently I am working on:
  - [Squirrel Logger Library](https://github.com/MrSquirrelyNet/Squirrel-Logger)
  - [Squirrel Sizer Library](https://github.com/MrSquirrelyNet/Squirrel-Sizer)
  - [Gitbugger Library](https://github.com/MrSquirrelyNet/GitBugger)
  - Something New! I'm always doing something!

I'm currently learning how to use Monogame and Unity to develop games. I've always wanted to make one!
