#Hello and Welcome to my Branch!ðŸ‘‹
-----
#### My name is James but you can just call me Mr. Squirrely!

I am a software developer who loves to create things! I use .net technology along with WPF and ASP.NET to create various different projects.
I am currently learning ASP.NET though, as I want to create my website [MrSquirrely.net](https://mrsquirrely.net) using ASP.NET.
I love to learn new things an I'm always challenging myself with every new project or recoding of an old project!
I am also currently learning Unity3D so I can create games, I have two projects I am thinking about doing!
I also created, updated, or creating various libraries to make things easier.
  - [Squirrel Sizer](https://github.com/MrSquirrely/Squirrel-Sizer) A simple file sizer utility (I am currently updating this with more features!)
  - [GitBugger](https://github.com/MrSquirrely/GitBugger) A simple utility to allow users to submit bugs to github from the app without needing an account
  - [Squirrel Logger](https://github.com/MrSquirrely/Squirrel-Logger) A logging extention library for Serilog
  - [DuplaImage.Lib](https://github.com/MrSquirrely/DuplaImage.Lib) (Currently on hold) finds duplicate images
  - [Squirrely Converter](https://github.com/MrSquirrely/SquirrelyConverter) A tool to convert various files to other various files
