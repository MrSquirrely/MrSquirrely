#Hello and Welcome to my Branch!ðŸ‘‹

#### My name is James but you can just call me Mr. Squirrely!

I am a software developer who loves to create things! I use .net technology along with WPF and Blazor to develop various projects.
I am currently learning Blazor to create my website! [MrSquirrely.net](https://mrsquirrely.net)
I love to learn new things and always challenge myself with every new project.
I am also currently learning Unity3D so I can create games.
